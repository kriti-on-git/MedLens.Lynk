## 🩺 **MedLens — AI-Powered Medical Report Analyzer**

### 🔍 **Project Description**

MedLens is an AI-driven health analysis tool that decodes your medical reports in seconds.
Upload your lab report (PDF or image), and MedLens extracts key health metrics like sugar, cholesterol, hemoglobin, etc., visualizes them, and explains their medical meaning — all in plain English.

The goal is to make diagnostic insights understandable to *anyone*, not just doctors. 
Fun Addition: Doctor Funshine (Fun personas reading your reports)

## 🧩 **Problem Statement**

Most people receive medical test reports full of complex terms, abbreviations, and numeric ranges they can’t interpret.
This creates confusion, anxiety, and dependence on external help — even for basic understanding.

We aim to bridge this communication gap between **medical data** and **human understanding**.

---

## 💡 **Proposed Solution**

MedLens leverages **OCR + AI-based interpretation** to:

1. Read medical reports intelligently (PDF or image).
2. Extract vital health metrics.
3. Generate easy-to-understand health summaries.
4. Visualize each parameter using intuitive graphs — comparing actual vs. normal values.

Built for accessibility, MedLens simplifies medical literacy for everyone.
